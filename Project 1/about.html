</title>
  </head>
My name is Katherine Kim and I am currently a student at Illinois Institute of Technology as an Information Technology Management major hoping to get a job in that field upon graduation. I am 28-years-old and currently live in Hinsdale, IL. My interests include computers, video games, art and animation, and writing. My hobbies generally correlate with my interests, such as using HTML and CSS to customize web pages, keeping up with animation and exploring artists, and doing writing projects. I currently own two pets, a pair of gerbil brothers.
